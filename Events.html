<p>Here is a list of the major international sports events in which teams from different countries battle it out, both for individual sports and multi-sport events. In these events countries of the world are brought together in competition - in some of these most countries of the world are represented, in others only a select few. See our discussion on the <a href="https://www.topendsports.com/world/lists/popular-event/index.htm" target="_blank">World's Most Popular Sporting Events</a>, there is no surprise that the FIFA World Cup and the Olympics top most lists.</p>

<h2>Defining The Most Popular</h2>
<p>To determine what is the world's most sport sporting event, and rank the others, we just need to know <strong>how many people watch</strong> each one. You can look at the crowd sizes, but that would be limited by the size of the stadiums. Also, events held over more than one day can accumulate large total crowd numbers. The methods used for measuring the viewer numbers can also vary, making comparisons between events difficult. Counting TV viewers sometimes estimate how many households a broadcast can reach, rather than how many people actually watched it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Measuring how many people watch each event is not the only possible measurement of popular. We could also look at tournament <strong>website visitors</strong> or Google <strong>search traffic</strong> to get another metric of popularity. As you can see, finding out the most popular sporting event is not simple at all. We will try and decipher the information available to create a meaningful list of the worlds most popular sports.</p>
<p>Here are the major events sorted by sport. If you know of others that should be listed here.</p>
